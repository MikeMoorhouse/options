Key terms explained

GCSE

General Certificate in Secondary Education (GCSE) assesses
students through a number of written examinations at the end of the
course. Coursework elements have been removed from most subjects
and a 9-1 assessment framework introduced for all subjects, with 9
being the highest grade and a grade 5 considered a ‘strong pass’.

OCR Nationals

Cambridge Nationals are designed specifically for students aged 14–
16. They are industry-relevant, geared to key sector requirements and
very popular with schools and colleges because they suit such a broad
range of learning styles and abilities and are an excellent start for
vocational study. They enable progression to Level 3 qualifications
such as Technical awards and A levels. Cambridge Nationals are
equivalent in value to GCSE and are included on the Key Stage 4
performance tables.

L2 Award

The Award is based on industry approved content and provides the
opportunity to inspire the next generation of young people to consider
a subject in its widest context as a career of choice. The L2 Award is
equivalent in value to GCSE and is included on the Key Stage 4
performance tables.

Year 9 Options 2026

Choices
A google form will be emailed to each student’s school email account after the Progress
Evening on Thursday 12th February 2026.

The deadline for this to be completed and submitted is Thursday 26th February 2026.
Students must choose a FIRST CHOICE and a SECOND CHOICE in each block.
We will always endeavour to accommodate your son’s first choice in each block but this
will not always be possible. The Principal reserves the right to withdraw or change the
curriculum offer for operational reasons such as staffing changes or low uptake of
students opting for the course.

Higher Education courses and Career pathways
GCSE History is a well-respected, academic qualification that will help you gain entry to a wide
variety of A-Levels, vocational courses or employment. Of course, if you wish to study History at
A-Level or University, GCSE History is evidence of your commitment, enthusiasm and skills,
and will prepare you for this future study. However, students who are successful in GCSE
History learn to write analytically, with precision, and this valuable trait is useful for any further
academic study.
History students gain so many transferable skills that employers in business, government and
education are often keen to recruit them. Such skills include research, communication and
statistical methods. Many teachers, politicians, civil servants, journalists and lawyers have a
background in historical study, not to mention archivists, archaeologists and others in a history
profession.
